ttrss_plugin-af_feedmod
=======================

This is a plugin for Tiny Tiny RSS (tt-rss). It allows you to replace an article's contents by the contents of an element on the linked URL's page, i.e. create a "full feed".


Installation
------------

Checkout the directory into your plugins folder like this (from tt-RSS root directory):

```sh
$ cd /var/www/ttrss
$ git clone git://github.com/mbirth/ttrss_plugin-af_feedmod.git plugins/af_feedmod
```

Then enable the plugin in preferences.


Configuration
-------------

The configuration is done in JSON format. In the preferences, you'll find a new tab called *FeedMod*. Use the large field to enter/modify the configuration data and click the **Save** button to store it.
You can enter an URL in the field below and click **Test** to get a preview what the result will be if the filter is applied to the url.

A configuration looks like this:

```json
{

"heise.de": {
    "type": "xpath",
    "xpath": "div[@class='meldung_wrapper']",
    "force_charset": "utf-8"
},
"berlin.de/polizei": {
    "type": "xpath",
    "xpath": "div[@class='bacontent']"
},
"n24.de": {
    "type": "xpath",
    "xpath": "div[@class='news']"
},
"golem0Bde0C": {
    "type": "xpath",
    "xpath": "article"
    "reformat": [
        {
            "type": "regex",
            "pattern": "/(?:[a-z0-9A-Z\\/.\\:]*?)golem0Bde0C(.*)0Erss0Bhtml\\/story01.htm/",
            "replace": "http://www.golem.de/$1.html"
        },
        {
            "type": "replace",
            "search": [
                "0A",
                "0C",
                "0B",
                "0E"
            ],
            "replace": [
                "0",
                "/",
                ".",
                "-"
            ]
        }
    ]
},
"oatmeal": {
    "type": "xpath",
    "xpath": "div[@id='comic']"
},
"blog.beetlebum.de": {
    "type": "xpath",
    "xpath": "div[@class='entry-content']",
    "cleanup": [ "header", "footer" ],
},
"www.spiegel.de": {
    "type": "split",
    "steps": [
        {
            "after": "/article-section clearfix\"\\W*>/",
            "before": "/<div\\W*class=\"module-box home-link-box/"
        },
        {
            "before": "/<div\\W*class=\"btwBarInArticles/"
        }
    ],
    "cleanup" : [ "~<script([^<]|<(?!/script))*</script>~msi" ],
    "force_unicode": true
}

}
```

The *array key* is part of the URL of the article links(!). You'll notice the `golem0Bde0C` in the last entry: That's because all their articles link to something like `http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/33374/f/578068/p/1/s/3f6db44e/l/0L0Sgolem0Bde0Cnews0Cthis0Eis0Ean0Eexample0A10Erss0Bhtml/story01.htm` and to have the plugin match that URL and not interfere with other feeds using *feedsportal.com*, I used the part `golem0Bde0C`.

**type** has to be `xpath` or `split`.

### xpath
The **xpath** value is the actual Xpath-element to fetch from the linked page. Omit the leading `//` - they will get prepended automatically.

There is an additional option **cleanup** available. Its an array of Xpath-elements (relative to the fetched node) to remove from the fetched node. Omit the leading `//` - they will get prepended automatically.

### split
The **steps** value is an array of actions performed in the given order. If **after** is given the content will be split using the value and the second half is used, if **before** the first half is used. preg_split is used for this action.

There is an additional option **cleanup** available. Its an array of regex that are removed using preg_replace.

### General options
**force_charset** allows to override automatic charset detection. If it is omitted, the charset will be parsed from the HTTP headers or loadHTML() will decide on its own.

**reformat** is an array of formating rules for the **url** of the full article. The rules are applied before the full article is fetched. There are two possible types: **regex** and **replace**. **regex** takes a regex in an option called **pattern** and the replacement in **replace**. For details see [preg_replace](http://www.php.net/manual/de/function.preg-replace.php) in the PHP documentation. **replace** uses the PHP function str_replace, which takes either a string or an array as search and replace value.

**modify** is the same as described above but for the content. It is applied after the split/xpath selection.

If you get an error about "Invalid JSON!", you can use [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/) to locate the erroneous part.


XPath
-----

### Tools

To test your XPath expressions, you can use these Chrome extensions:

* [XPath Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xpath-helper/hgimnogjllphhhkhlmebbmlgjoejdpjl)
* [xPath Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xpath-viewer/oemacabgcknpcikelclomjajcdpbilpf)
* [xpathOnClick](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xpathonclick/ikbfbhbdjpjnalaooidkdbgjknhghhbo)


### Examples

Some XPath expressions you could need (the `//` is automatically prepended and must be omitted in the FeedMod configuration):

##### HTML5 &lt;article&gt; tag

```html
<article>…article…</article>
```

```xslt
//article
```

##### DIV inside DIV

```html
<div id="content"><div class="box_content">…article…</div></div>`
```

```xslt
//div[@id='content']/div[@class='box_content']
```

##### Multiple classes

```html
<div class="post-body entry-content xh-highlight">…article…</div>
```

```xslt
//div[starts-with(@class ,'post-body')]
```
or
```xslt
//div[contains(@class, 'entry-content')]
```
